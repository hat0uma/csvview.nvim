    },
  },
  cmd = { "CsvViewEnable", "CsvViewDisable", "CsvViewToggle" },
}
```

### vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'hat0uma/csvview.nvim'
lua require('csvview').setup()
```

## üõ†Ô∏è  Configuration

`csvview.nvim` are highly customizable, Please refer to the following default settings.

<details>

<summary>Default Settings</summary>

```lua
{
  parser = {
    --- The number of lines that the asynchronous parser processes per cycle.
    --- This setting is used to prevent monopolization of the main thread when displaying large files.
    --- If the UI freezes, try reducing this value.
    --- @type integer
    async_chunksize = 50,

    --- Specifies the delimiter character to separate columns.
    --- This can be configured in one of three ways:
    ---
    --- 1. As a single string for a fixed delimiter.
    ---    e.g., delimiter = ","
    ---
    --- 2. As a function that dynamically returns the delimiter.
    ---    e.g., delimiter = function(bufnr) return "\t" end
    ---
    --- 3. As a table for advanced configuration:
    ---    - `ft`: Maps filetypes to specific delimiters. This has the highest priority.
    ---    - `fallbacks`: An ordered list of delimiters to try for automatic detection
    ---      when no `ft` rule matches. The plugin will test them in sequence and use
    ---      the first one that highest scores based on the number of fields in each line.
    ---
    --- Note: Only fixed-length strings are supported as delimiters.
    --- Regular expressions (e.g., `\s+`) are not currently supported.
    --- @type CsvView.Options.Parser.Delimiter
    delimiter = {
      ft = {
        csv = ",",
        tsv = "\t",
      },
      fallbacks = {
        ",",
        "\t",
        ";",
        "|",
        ":",
        " ",
      },
    },

    --- The quote character
    --- If a field is enclosed in this character, it is treated as a single field and the delimiter in it will be ignored.
    --- e.g:
    ---  quote_char= "'"
    --- You can also specify it on the command line.
    --- e.g:
    --- :CsvViewEnable quote_char='
    --- @type string
    quote_char = '"',

    --- The comment prefix characters
    --- If the line starts with one of these characters, it is treated as a comment.
    --- Comment lines are not displayed in tabular format.
    --- You can also specify it on the command line.
    --- e.g:
    --- :CsvViewEnable comment=#
    --- @type string[]
    comments = {
      -- "#",
      -- "--",
      -- "//",
    },

    --- Maximum lookahead for multi-line fields
    --- This limits how many lines ahead the parser will look when trying to find 
    --- the closing quote of a multi-line field. Setting this too high may cause
    --- performance issues when editing files with unmatched quotes.
    --- @type integer
    max_lookahead = 50,
  },
  view = {
    --- minimum width of a column
    --- @type integer
    min_column_width = 5,

    --- spacing between columns
    --- @type integer
    spacing = 2,

    --- The display method of the delimiter
    --- "highlight" highlights the delimiter
    --- "border" displays the delimiter with `‚îÇ`
    --- You can also specify it on the command line.
    --- e.g:
    --- :CsvViewEnable display_mode=border
    ---@type CsvView.Options.View.DisplayMode
    display_mode = "highlight",

    --- The line number of the header row
    --- Controls which line should be treated as the header for the CSV table.
    --- This affects both visual styling and the sticky header feature.
    ---
    --- Values:
    --- - `true`: Automatically detect the header line (default)
    --- - `integer`: Specific line number to use as header (1-based)
    --- - `false`: No header line, treat all lines as data rows
    ---
    --- When a header is defined, it will be:
    --- - Highlighted with the CsvViewHeaderLine highlight group
    --- - Used for the sticky header feature if enabled
    --- - Excluded from normal data processing in some contexts
    ---
    --- See also: `view.sticky_header`
    --- @type integer|false|true
    header_lnum = true,

    --- The sticky header feature settings
    --- If `view.header_lnum` is set, the header line is displayed at the top of the window.
    sticky_header = {
      --- Whether to enable the sticky header feature
      --- @type boolean
      enabled = true,

      --- The separator character for the sticky header window
      --- set `false` to disable the separator
      --- @type string|false
      separator = "‚îÄ",
    },
  },

  --- Keymaps for csvview.
  --- These mappings are only active when csvview is enabled.
  --- You can assign key mappings to each action defined in `opts.actions`.
  --- For example:
  --- ```lua
  --- keymaps = {
  ---   -- Text objects for selecting fields
  ---   textobject_field_inner = { "if", mode = { "o", "x" } },
  ---   textobject_field_outer = { "af", mode = { "o", "x" } },
  ---
  ---   -- Excel-like navigation:
  ---   -- Use <Tab> and <S-Tab> to move horizontally between fields.
  ---   -- Use <Enter> and <S-Enter> to move vertically between rows.
  ---   -- Note: In terminals, you may need to enable CSI-u mode to use <S-Tab> and <S-Enter>.
  ---   jump_next_field_end = { "<Tab>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
  ---   jump_prev_field_end = { "<S-Tab>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
  ---   jump_next_row = { "<Enter>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
  ---   jump_prev_row = { "<S-Enter>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
  ---
  ---   -- Custom key mapping example:
  ---   { "<leader>h", function() print("hello") end, mode = "n" },
  --- }
  --- ```
  --- @type CsvView.Options.Keymaps
  keymaps = {},

  --- Actions for keymaps.
  ---@type CsvView.Options.Actions
  actions = {
    -- See lua/csvview/config.lua
  },
}
```

## üéØ Getting Started

#### Basic Commands

| Command                    | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `:CsvViewEnable [options]` | Enable CSV view with the specified options      |

```

## üìã Feature Guide

<details>
<summary><strong>Delimiter Configuration & Auto-Detection</strong></summary>

csvview.nvim provides flexible delimiter handling with intelligent auto-detection capabilities.

#### Auto-Detection (Recommended)

The plugin automatically detects the most appropriate delimiter by analyzing your file content:

```lua
-- Default configuration with auto-detection
{
  parser = {
    delimiter = {
      ft = {
        csv = ",",        -- Always use comma for .csv files
        tsv = "\t",       -- Always use tab for .tsv files
      },
      fallbacks = {       -- Try these delimiters in order for other files
        ",",              -- Comma (most common)
        "\t",             -- Tab
        ";",              -- Semicolon
        "|",              -- Pipe
        ":",              -- Colon
        " ",              -- Space
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**How auto-detection works:**

1. If the file type matches `ft` rules (e.g., `.csv` ‚Üí comma), use that delimiter
2. Otherwise, test each delimiter in `fallbacks` order
3. Score each delimiter based on field consistency across lines
4. Select the delimiter with the highest score

#### Manual Delimiter Configuration

**Fixed delimiter for all files:**

```lua
{
  parser = {
    delimiter = ",",  -- Always use comma
  },
}
```

**Dynamic delimiter with function:**

```lua
{
  parser = {
    delimiter = function(bufnr)
      local filename = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(bufnr)
      if filename:match("%.tsv$") then
        return "\t"
      end
      return ","
    end,
  },
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-character delimiters are supported (e.g., `||`, `::`, `<>`), but regular expression patterns are not supported (e.g., `\s+`).

#### Command-line Delimiter Options

```vim
" For unknown file formats, let auto-detection work
:CsvViewEnable

" Specific delimiters
:CsvViewEnable delimiter=,
:CsvViewEnable delimiter=\t

" Special characters (use escape sequences)
:CsvViewEnable delimiter=\   " Space
:CsvViewEnable delimiter=\t  " Tab
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Display Configuration</strong></summary>

#### Display Modes

**Highlight Mode (Default)**

Highlights delimiter characters in place:

```lua
{
  view = {
    display_mode = "highlight",
  },
}
```

**Border Mode**

Replaces delimiters with vertical borders (`‚îÇ`):

```lua
{
  view = {
    display_mode = "border",
  },
}
```

**Toggle display modes:**

```vim
:CsvViewEnable display_mode=highlight
:CsvViewEnable display_mode=border
```

#### Column Layout

```lua
{
  view = {
    min_column_width = 5,  -- Minimum width for each column
    spacing = 2,           -- Space between columns
  },
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sticky Header & Header Auto-Detection</strong></summary>

Keep header rows visible while scrolling through large CSV files.

#### Header Auto-Detection (Recommended)

The plugin automatically detects header rows by analyzing file content:

```lua
-- Default configuration with auto-detection
{
  view = {
    header_lnum = true,  -- Auto-detect header (default)
    sticky_header = {
      enabled = true,
      separator = "‚îÄ",  -- Separator line character
    },
  },
}
```

**How header auto-detection works:**

1. Find the first non-comment line as header candidate
2. Analyze each column independently using two heuristics:
   - **Type Mismatch**: If the first row contains text while data rows are numeric, it's likely a header
   - **Length Deviation**: If the first row's text length differs significantly from data rows, it's likely a header
3. Combine evidence from all columns to make the final decision

#### Manual Header Configuration

**Fixed header line:**

```lua
{
  view = {
    header_lnum = 1,  -- Use line 1 as header
    -- header_lnum = 3,  -- Use line 3 as header
  },
}
```

**Disable header:**

```lua
{
  view = {
    header_lnum = false,  -- No header line
  },
}
```

#### Command-line usage

```vim
:CsvViewEnable header_lnum=auto  " Auto-detect header (default)
:CsvViewEnable header_lnum=1     " First line as header
:CsvViewEnable header_lnum=none  " No header line
```

#### Customize Separator

```lua
{
  view = {
    sticky_header = {
      separator = "‚ïê",     -- Double line
      -- separator = false, -- No separator
    },
  },
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Navigation & Text Objects</strong></summary>

#### Excel-like Navigation

Navigate between fields and rows with familiar keyboard shortcuts:

```lua
{
  keymaps = {
    -- Horizontal navigation
    jump_next_field_end = { "<Tab>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
    jump_prev_field_end = { "<S-Tab>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
    
    -- Vertical navigation  
    jump_next_row = { "<Enter>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
    jump_prev_row = { "<S-Enter>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
  },
}
```

#### Text Objects for Field Selection

```lua
{
  keymaps = {
    -- Select field content (inner)
    textobject_field_inner = { "if", mode = { "o", "x" } },
    
    -- Select field including delimiter (outer)  
    textobject_field_outer = { "af", mode = { "o", "x" } },
  },
}
```

**Usage examples:**

- `vif` - Select current field content
- `vaf` - Select current field including delimiter
- `dif` - Delete field content
- `caf` - Change entire field

#### Custom Navigation

```lua
-- Jump to specific field position
require("csvview.jump").field(0, {
  pos = { 2, 3 },      -- Row 2, Column 3
  mode = "absolute",
  anchor = "start",    -- Place cursor at field start
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Quote Character Configuration</strong></summary>

Handle quoted fields that contain delimiters or special characters.

#### Basic Quote Configuration

```lua
{
  parser = {
    quote_char = '"',   -- Standard double quotes (default)
    -- quote_char = "'", -- Single quotes
  },
}
```

#### How Quoted Fields Work

When a field is enclosed in quote characters, the delimiter inside is ignored:

```csv
name,description,value
John,"Smith, Jr.",100
Jane,"O'Connor ""Jane""",200
```

In this example:

- `"Smith, Jr."` contains a comma but is treated as one field
- `"O'Connor ""Jane"""` contains escaped quotes within the field

#### Command-line Usage

```vim
" Use double quotes (default)
:CsvViewEnable quote_char="

" Use single quotes
:CsvViewEnable quote_char='

" Disable quote handling (not recommended)
:CsvViewEnable quote_char=
```

#### Multi-line Field Support

Quoted fields can span multiple lines:

```csv
id,description
1,"This is a long
description that spans
multiple lines"
2,"Another field"
```

Configure the parser for multi-line fields:

```lua
{
  parser = {
    max_lookahead = 50,  -- Maximum lines to search for closing quotes
  },
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Multi-line Field Configuration</strong></summary>

Handle CSV fields that span multiple lines when properly quoted.

#### Basic Configuration

```lua
{
  parser = {
    max_lookahead = 50,  -- Maximum lines to search for closing quotes
  },
}
```

#### How Multi-line Fields Work

When a field starts with a quote character but doesn't end on the same line, the parser will search ahead for the closing quote:

```csv
id,description,notes
1,"This field contains
multiple lines of text
with embedded newlines",Short note
2,"Another multi-line field
that spans several lines",Another note
```

**Adjust `max_lookahead` based on your data:**

- Increase for files with long multi-line fields (e.g., `max_lookahead = 200`)
- Decrease for simple CSV files to improve performance (e.g., `max_lookahead = 10`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Comment Line Handling</strong></summary>

Skip comment lines from the table display to focus on data rows.

#### Basic Comment Configuration

```lua
{
  parser = {
    comments = { "#", "//", "--" },  -- Lines starting with these are ignored
  },
}
```

#### Comment Examples

```csv
# This is a comment line
// Another comment style
-- SQL-style comment
name,age,city
John,25,NYC
# Comments can appear anywhere
Jane,30,LA
```

Only the data rows (`name,age,city`, `John,25,NYC`, `Jane,30,LA`) will be displayed in the table format.

#### Command-line Usage

```vim
" Enable hash comments
:CsvViewEnable comment=#

" Enable C++ style comments  
:CsvViewEnable comment=//

" Enable SQL style comments
:CsvViewEnable comment=--

" Multiple comment types (requires Lua configuration)
```

#### Advanced Comment Configuration

```lua
{
  parser = {
    comments = {
      "#",        -- Shell/Python style
      "//",       -- C++ style  
      "--",       -- SQL style
      ";;",       -- Custom comment prefix
    },
  },
}
```

#### Use Cases

- **Data files with metadata**: Skip header comments explaining the data format
- **Generated CSV files**: Ignore generator information or timestamps  
- **Configuration files**: Skip documentation lines in CSV-like config files
- **Log analysis**: Focus on data rows while ignoring log headers

</details>

## üåà Highlights

The plugin uses the following highlight groups for customizing colors and appearance:

| Group                            | Default                    | Purpose                          |
