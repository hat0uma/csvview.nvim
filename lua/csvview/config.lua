    --- The delimiter character
    --- You can specify a string, a table of delimiter characters for each file type, or a function that returns a delimiter character.
    --- e.g:
    ---  delimiter = ","
    ---  delimiter = function(bufnr) return "," end
    ---  delimiter = {
    ---    default = ",",
    ---    ft = {
    ---      tsv = "\t",

      default = ",",
      ft = {
        tsv = "\t",
      },
    },

    --- The quote character
    --- If a field is enclosed in this character, it is treated as a single field and the delimiter in it will be ignored.
    --- e.g:
    ---  quote_char= "'"
    --- You can also specify it on the command line.
    --- e.g:
    --- :CsvViewEnable quote_char='
    --- @type string
    quote_char = "\"",

    --- The comment prefix characters
    --- If the line starts with one of these characters, it is treated as a comment.
    --- Comment lines are not displayed in tabular format.
    --- You can also specify it on the command line.
    --- e.g:
    --- :CsvViewEnable comment=#
    --- @type string[]
    comments = {
      -- "#",
      -- "--",
      -- "//",
